  <h1>Software Design Writing Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>As humans, we interact with software more than we realize, and it is a fundamental aspect of living as a human. One example of software that stands out to me and I think is designed with extreme intricacy and care is a Tesla car. The user-friendly design is key in my opinion, it’s extremely easy to do basic tasks, such as switching on the air conditioning, whereas with a lot of gas powered cars it can be difficult trying to find the correct buttons to click. Another thing I love about the Tesla software is the built-in safety features it contains. Notably, the feature that lets you know when the air pressure of one of your tires is low, displaying a warning sign to safely pull over and check for a puncture. The Tesla has one big screen where you can see all the controls of your car and there’s a built-in map feature to make navigating easy. Why I think this is so important, even though you can argue a regular car can do all the same things, is the way the Tesla chooses to display it’s features. It’s extremely easy to use and very user-friendly, which I think is the reason why it’s fundamentally a better internal software design than every other car on the market. The minimalistic approach reduces complexity and frustration, making it more appealing to use and purchase. This shows how important software design can be, even though it may seem like only the features of a car matter, the way the car displays it may be even more important.  In an era where technology affects every aspect of our lives, clear and aesthetically appealing software design becomes crucial. It improves usability, enhances safety, and ultimately shapes how we engage with technology. This makes software design as important as the functionality itself.

  <h1>Software Design Writing Assignment 2</h1>
  <p>As we have learned in class, the requirements gathering phase of a software project is one of the most important parts of project development. In this phase, the developers work with the stakeholders to understand what the client would like and the project’s goal in general. This helps them to get a specific idea of what to create, and involves techniques as we did in the labs (interviews and surveys). When we interviewed our client in the lab, we were able to narrow down and flesh out a concrete idea of what the client wanted, rather than being unclear about the next steps in our app development. This process helps with debugging later on and ensures that all parties, the creators and the consumers alike, are in agreement with the final product. It also fully ensures that the final product can offer real value by addressing all user needs and meeting the outlined objectives. All in all, a successful and well-thought-out requirements gathering process is extremely important for a successful project, ensuring that the software’s design and features are aligned with its purpose and client’s vision from the very beginning. This step is crucial to keeping the development process on track and avoiding major setbacks.

    Five User Stories for the Tesla Software:
    
1. As a driver, I want to have touchscreen access to air conditioning settings so that I can conveniently manage the temperature while driving easily.
2. As a driver, I want to be notified when my tire pressure (PSI) drops suddenly so that I may pull over safely and prevent further damage to my tires.
3. As a driver, I want to use a simple and well-thought out navigation system so that I can quickly see my location and enter a destination I'd like to go to without having to use a different device.
4. As a driver, I want to be able to monitor my car's battery usage and schedule all my charging stops by being able to see the battery status fully accurate on the central screen.
5. As a driver, I want to use the central touchscreen to control the music and entertainment system while driving so that I may change the audio easily with no distractions or dangerous maneuvers.
